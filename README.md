I have alto studyied Java and some tools for Full-Stack Development through a scolarship provided by Santander, but decided to quit because I got a job offer.

- 🌱 I’ve recently recieved a scolarship for technology studies from Santander, but decided to quit. Now I'm applying my knowledges at a internship at CNI.
