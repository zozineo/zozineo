- 👋 Hi, I’m @zozineo! I'm a self-taught begginer programer, and I've learned Python through some on-line tutorials! Currently, I'm studying Java and some tools for Full-Stack Development. Besides my interest for coding and developing technologies, I study International Relations and Economics at the University of Brasilia (UnB) and work at the Inovatio Department at the National Confederation of Industries (CNI)!
- 👀 I’m interested in GameDev, Web Development and Data Science (for now) and any kind of programing lenguage that allows me to create impactful projects!
- 🌱 I’ve recently recieved a scolarship for technology studies from Santander, so I'm currently studying Full-Stack Web Development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning new programing skills and practicing! My next steps are going to be learning and understanding Java and C++.
- 📫 You can reach me through the following email: enzo.ramos2001@gmail.com
