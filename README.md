- 👋 Hi, I’m @zozineo! I'm a self-taught begginer programer, and I'm learning Python through some on-line tutorials! Besides my interest for coding and developing technologies, I study International Relations and Economics at the University of Brasilia (UnB)!
- 👀 I’m interested in GameDev (for now) and any kind of programing lenguage that allows me to create impactful projects!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some basic functions and some begginer projects in Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning new programing skills and practicing! My next steps are going to be learning and understanding Java and C++.
